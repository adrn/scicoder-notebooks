      "The output of the spectral reduction pipeline is a massive (well, sorta) FITS file (~1.91 GB) containing several derived parameters -- e.g., surface gravity, effective temp., metallicty -- for 1843200 stars. Each row in the FITS table represents a single star. The spectral data is in `data/ssppOut-dr9.fits`. The first group of columns are SDSS bit flags and survey info about the targets. Starting around __SPECTYPE_HAMMER__, they start to get interesting. __SPECTYPE_HAMMER__ and __SPECTYPE_SUBCLASS__ are attempts to classify the spectrum of the star. A little further down, notice there are a ton of columns starting with __TEFF__. These are different methods for measuring the effective temperature of the star. Similarly, __LOGG__ (surface gravity) and __FEH__ (metallicity) have a bunch of measurements as well. We're going to stick to using the adopted values, __TEFF_ADOP__, __LOGG_ADOP__, and __FEH_ADOP__.\n",

      "Additionally, we've provided photometry for stars around several globular and open clusters in the SDSS footprint. We'll come back to this in a bit, but these files are located in `data/cluster_photometry`."
